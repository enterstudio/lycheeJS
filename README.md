# lycheeJS (v0.3)

lycheeJS is an HTML5 game library that offers a
complete environment for prototyping and deployment
of JavaScript based games.

There's also a not-yet-opensourced compiler available
that is able to deliver Android native apps and will
be improved to deliver iOS platforms as well.

This Android shim uses a combination of V8 and a 
native GL renderer that allows faster frame rates
than running in the Web Browser(s).


# Roadmap

**v0.4 (June 2012)**

- lychee.Tokenizer
- lychee.Parser
- lychee.Compiler
- platform/webgl

**v0.5 (July 2012)**

- platform/node

**v0.6 (August 2012)**

- platform/android

**v0.7 (-)**

As it is currently focussed on an Entity-based rendering
architecture, it is planned to support a SceneGraph-based
architecture.

# Features

I'm not a marketing guy, so I don't give a shit on
selling you stuff. it's open source, grab the demos
and grab the code, dude!


# Examples / Demos

There are many demos available that explain the usage
of the APIs and the suggested coding-style.

To view them in the browser, you can navigate through
them here:
